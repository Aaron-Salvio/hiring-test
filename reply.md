Hello Alice,

Thanks for getting in touch.

I checked the issue with `site.recruitment.shq.nz`. The website is up and running on the server, but it looks like there's a problem with the HTTPS (SSL) setup.

That’s why your browser can’t load the page—it’s blocking the connection because it can’t verify the site’s security.

Here’s how your web team can fix it:
1. Make sure there’s a valid SSL certificate installed for `site.recruitment.shq.nz`.
2. Check that the server is correctly set up to handle HTTPS (port 443) for that domain.
3. Restart the web server after making those changes.

To confirm I was able to reach the site another way, I found this code in the page’s source:

`SHF1ZzYwcVJDdVFVb3hFOVFBc2FaU3lVZjhnRFpoYXZPOWt5clRVY1dBPT0=`

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.
        
Best,  
Aaron
